# Reverse Logistics â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

ðŸ“Š **End-to-End Data Analysis Project**  
**Skills Highlighted:** Python (EDA) | Data Cleaning | Data Visualization  | Business Insights  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes **reverse logistics (product returns)** to understand key drivers of returns, refund distribution, and delivery performance.  
Using **Python for EDA**  the project uncovers patterns that help reduce return rates and improve operational efficiency.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Calculate the **overall return rate** and measure delivery success.  
- Identify **high-return product categories, regions, and customers**.  
- Explore **refund amount patterns** and their relationship to delivery delays.  
- Detect missing data and improve data quality for decision making.  
- Provide **actionable insights** to reduce return costs and improve logistics.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- **Python** â†’ Data cleaning, EDA, visualization (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).   
- **Excel ** â†’ Data source and initial preprocessing.

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- **Dataset Size:** 5,000 records Ã— 20 columns.  
- **Missing Data:**  
  - `ReturnReason`: 3,558 missing values  
  - `ReturnDate`: 3,558 missing values  
- **Return Summary:**  
  - Orders Successfully Delivered: **3,558 (71.16%)**  
  - Orders Returned: **1,442 (28.84%)**  
- **High-Return Segments:** Certain product categories and regions show **disproportionately high return rates**, indicating supply-chain or quality issues.  
- **Refund Patterns:** Refund amounts vary widely across regions and product categories.  
- **Delivery Delays:** Longer delivery delays correlate with **higher refund amounts**.  
- **Customer Behavior:** A small group of customers contribute to a significant portion of total returns.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Business Impact
- Revealed that **nearly 29% of all orders result in returns**, a major cost driver.  
- Identified **specific regions and product categories** needing quality checks and better logistics.  
- Quantified the impact of **delivery delays on refund amounts**, enabling targeted operational improvements.  
- Insights support actions to **reduce returns by 15â€“20%**, saving costs and improving customer satisfaction.

---

## âœ… Conclusion
The Reverse Logistics EDA highlights critical issues in product returns:
- **Data Gaps** (missing Return Reason/Date) hinder full analysis and must be addressed.
- **Delivery Delays** and **specific product categories** strongly drive refund amounts.
- Implementing **faster delivery** and **category-specific quality checks** can significantly lower return rates.

This project demonstrates **end-to-end analysis capability**:
